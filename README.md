## 🚀 Introduction

MAESTRO is a groundbreaking evaluation framework designed specifically for multi-agent LLM systems. Unlike traditional testing tools, MAESTRO provides comprehensive insights into agent interactions, decision-making processes, and overall system performance through advanced NLP metrics and AI-powered analysis.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📊 Comprehensive Metrics

- **Agent Routing Analysis**: Evaluate agent selection accuracy using fuzzy matching
- **Tool Usage Assessment**: Measure the appropriateness and efficiency of tool selections
- **Response Quality Metrics**: BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and semantic similarity analysis
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time performance dashboards and metric breakdowns

### 🧠 AI-Powered Evaluation

- **Gemini Judge Integration**: Advanced qualitative analysis using Google's Gemini AI
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring patterns in agent behaviors
- **Semantic Understanding**: Deep analysis of response coherence and relevance

### 📈 Performance Analytics

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track system performance as interactions occur
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customize evaluation criteria for your specific needs
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate comprehensive performance reports with actionable insights

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maestro.git
cd maestro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 🚦 Quick Start

1. Prepare Your Data

   - Format your ground truth data in CSV
   - Collect system logs in the specified format
2. Launch the Dashboard

   ```bash
   streamlit run agno_metrics_ui.py
   ```
3. Configure Settings

   - Set evaluation thresholds
   - Configure BLEU and ROUGE parameters
   - Add your Gemini API key for AI analysis

## 📖 Usage Example

```python
from evaluator import AgentEvaluator

# Initialize evaluator
evaluator = AgentEvaluator(
    ground_truth_path="truth.csv",
    logs_path="system_logs.log"
)

# Run evaluation
metrics, coverage = evaluator.evaluate_all()

# Generate report
print(f"System Coverage: {coverage*100:.1f}%")
print(f"Routing Accuracy: {metrics['routing_accuracy']:.2f}")
```

```

## 🔧 Configuration
MAESTRO is highly configurable through config.py :

```python
DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
    'rouge_metrics': ['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'],
    'semantic_threshold': 0.7,
    'routing_threshold': 0.8,
    'response_quality_threshold': 0.6,
    # ... more configuration options
}
```

## 📊 Visualization Examples

- Bar charts for accuracy metrics
- Polar plots for similarity scores
- Line graphs for ROUGE scores
- Interactive metric dashboards
